        "\n",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP techniques are used in a wide range of applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and speech recognition.\n",
